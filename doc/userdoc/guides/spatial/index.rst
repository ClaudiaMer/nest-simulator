Spatially-structured networks
=============================

Here you can find how to build complex, layered networks in NEST.

* Here you can find an :doc:`overview of spatially-structured networks <overview_spatial>`
* If you're new to spatially-structured networks, :doc:`check out our tutorial <../../tutorials/pynest_tutorial/part_4_spatially_structured_networks>`
* For an in depth look, we have a comprehensive guide to :doc:`spatially-structured networks <guide_spatially_structured_networks>`
* Witin our :doc:`example networks <../../examples/index>`, you can find spatially-structured networks
