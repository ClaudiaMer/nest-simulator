================

NEST simulator is part of a larger network of projects focusing on simulation, analysis, visualization, and modeling of
biologically realistic neural networks.

Here you can find further information about some of these projects.

NESTML
------

:doc:`NESTML <nestml:sphinx-apidoc/index>` is a domain-specific language that supports the specification of neuron
models in a precise and concise syntax, based on the syntax of Python. Model equations can either be given as a simple
string of mathematical notation or as an algorithm written in the built-in procedural language. The equations are
analyzed by the associated toolchain, written in Python, to compute an exact solution if possible or use an appropriate
numeric solver otherwise.

NEST desktop
------------

:doc:`NEST Desktop <desktop:index>` is a web-based GUI application for NEST Simulator
The app enables the rapid construction, parametrization, and instrumentation of neuronal network models.

PyNN:
-----

:doc:`PyNN <pynn:index>` is a simulator-independent language for building neuronal network models.

In other words, you can write the code for a model once, using the PyNN API and the Python programming language, and
then run it without modification on any simulator that PyNN supports (currently NEURON, NEST, and Brian) and on a
number of neuromorphic hardware systems.

Elephant
--------

:doc:`Elephant (Electrophysiology Analysis Toolkit) <elephant:index>` is an emerging open-source, community centered
library for the analysis of electrophysiological data in the Python programming language.
