Spatially-structured networks
=============================

Here you can find how to build complex, layered networks in NEST.

.. note::

  In NEST 2.x spatially-structured networks were in the topology module.
  This module is removed in NEST 3.0, and all functionality that was
  formerly provided by the topology module is now in the main ``nest`` module.
